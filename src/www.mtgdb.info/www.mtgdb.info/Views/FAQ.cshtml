<h4>What is this ALPHA version thingy?</h4>
<p>This is a very early release, so/and therefore we expect some hiccups and bumps. However, we want to make this tool as great as possible! We appreciate your early input. We'll make frequent small releases at this phase, and once things are stable we'll move onto BETA.</p>
<h4>I can't sign in, sign up, or reset my password, HELPPPppp...?</h4>
<p><a href="mailto:planeswalker@mtgdb.info">Contact us</a>!</p>
<h4>What is the benefit of registering?</h4>
<p>When you sign up, you get access to a growing suite of Planeswalker tools such as "MyCards", where you can keep record of your card inventory. We strive to get you the best tools out there - FOR FREE!</p>
<h4>After I sign in, why are some cards grey?</h4>
<p>This is to indicate that you do not have this card in your inventory. You can add cards through browsing the set binders, searching and in the My Card sections.</p>
<h4>On My Cards, all I see is cards I own. How can I see cards I don't have?</h4>
<p>Each set tab is a toggle button. Once a tab is active, you can click the tab again. The tab will turn green indicating the tab is showing all cards. You will now see all cards available and cards you don't own will be grey. You can then mouse over and add cards on the popover. To see only the cards you do own again, click the tab agian. It should no longer be green and only displaying cards in your library.</p>
<h4>Why should I use M:tgDb over the many other online resouces?</h4>
